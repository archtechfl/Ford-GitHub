Ford-GitHub
===========

This is a project to create a political surveying system combining CSS3, Javascript, AJAX, PHP, mySQL and Chart.JS (HTML5 Canvas 2D)
for the purpose of people gauging how aligned they are with a particular candidate. Info on how everyone has responded is displayed,
and then updated alongside a respondent's position once the survey is complete.


The survey and overall stats can be viewed as part of thetruthaboutrobford.com
